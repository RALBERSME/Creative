          He snorted angrily through his nose and spat on the ground in front of
          him. He stared again at the dial of his Chinese Rolex. No question, 8
          a.m. was long past and there was no trace of the cheeky brat. What
          happened? Had she not found the way? Lost in the forest again? Women
          and a sense of direction simply didn't go together...plus, today's
          young people could no longer be relied on. The grizzled wolf shook his
          head in frustration. How he had been looking forward to the fresh meat
          two hours ago, how he longed for it so much, when he - according to
          the Brothers Grimm script - choked down his porous and emaciated
          grandmother. The old lady certainly wasn't tasty. Neither in
          appearance nor in taste. But, the wolf had consoled himself as he
          burped, the dashing girl would compensate him for it, yes, he would
          have to compensate him! Otherwise, the fairytale uncles might like him
          in the future.

          “The Wolf and the 3 Little Pigs”, “The Wolf and the 7 Little Kids”,
          “Little Red Riding Hood” were all pieces that took a toll on his
          health and gave him increasingly less joy. So he had had to stumble
          around all day in his grandmother's musty, old-fashioned nightgown and
          now dinner was canceled too? That was shit! He heard his stomach
          growling and felt the deep hole in his stomach. it could not go on
          like that. Tomorrow, he vowed, he would go on an indefinite sit-in.
          But tonight he still needed something to bite.
          <br />
          <br />

          It did not help. He had to look for Little Red Riding Hood. He quickly
          took the forest path to Käppchensrot. Twilight had set in and the
          shadows were getting longer and longer. Every few meters the wolf
          stopped and sniffed. It smelled of fresh spruce leaves and pine
          greens, but not of her, the sweet thing. The pale moonlight showed him
          the way across the clearing. But there were no signs of the busty
          beauty here either. Whenever the wolf thought of her, his mouth
          watered. Full of greed, he now began to call her name: “Red Riding
          Hood, Little Cap, Little Dove, where are you?” Full of excitement, he
          forgot all the stage directions. How many times had the sound engineer
          warned him to speak in a sonorous, high voice, just like his
          grandmother did. But no, he bawled as he pleased. And so it happened
          that the hunter heard him.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the loaded rifle, the hunter crept up to the wolf from behind.
          His thumb unlocked the gun. Then the hunter aimed at the wolf. But
          what he saw through his night vision glass robbed him of all his
          concentration: a full-grown, stocky wolf in a crocheted pointed cap
          and squeezed into a frilly nightgown that was too small, limping in
          front of him in pink felt slippers and pining for his beloved.
          <br />
          <br />
          “How touching,” grinned the hunter, “whether he is dessed?” In short,
          he decided to try a test. So he crept into the bushes, disguised his
          voice and breathed gently: “here, here my darling, I am here”. Then he
          changed hiding places and soon “Darling, here” was heard from across
          the street. The wolf's eyes got bigger, the drool flowed from his
          mouth and he jumped straight towards the first bush. But already the
          voice sounded behind him. He turned around quickly. But now it echoed
          from the left, then from the right... the wolf opened its mouth and
          pounced on the creature next to him.
          <br />
          <br />
          Bang! <br />
          <br />
          A shot rang out. Then there was peace. Mouse silence. The silence of
          uncertainty lasted a long time. Very long. It should first be
          interrupted by a quiet melody. It was the singing of a young girl:
          “boom bumm tschacka, tschacka, hey”. Ok, the singing wasn't that quiet
          after all. Little Red Riding Hood sang the lyrics at the top of her
          lungs as she whizzed through the forest on her moped. As a poor
          student, she had to rely on the money that the pizza service paid her
          for the trip to her grandmother's. That's why she allowed herself to
          be persuaded to deliver the Quattro Formaggio at a late hour.
          <br />
          <br />
          She was lucky that night, because the shot made the wolf aware of the
          hunter's presence and now feared for his life. He therefore preferred
          to remain silent in the bushes until the end of filming. Meanwhile,
          the hunter bled to death - two meters away from him. He had gotten
          tangled up in his own rifle.
          <br />
          <br />
          And the moral of the story: Women are less likely to get lost in the
          forest than you think.
