          <p>How to appear self-confident during your speech:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Without hesitation, go onto the stage and take your position
              there. Don't start yet, let your eyes wander over the audience
              first. Give the audience a smile. Then take another deep breath
              before you begin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Realize that people have come to listen to your words. They trust
              that you can do it. You want it to be a successful presentation.
              So they are on your side. See them as friends, not enemies.
            </li>
            <li>Think about all the things you have already accomplished.</li>
            <li>
              Prepare well for your speech before you give it. This not only
              means working on the speech, but also practicing it in advance. Be
              critical of yourself and change all the passages until everything
              seems fluid, as if from a single source. Eliminate overly long
              sentences. Vary the sentence length and constructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you fear that you won't remember all the points in your speech,
              set yourself so-called ground anchors. As you practice, imagine
              that the individual dots are stuck in different places on the
              stage. As soon as you talk about a point, you go to that spot on
              the stage. Choose places that are not too far apart and that don't
              make your movements on stage seem strange to the audience. The
              maximum should be 3 to 5 points.
