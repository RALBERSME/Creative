              Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled
              peppers Peter Piper picked. If Peter Piper picked a peck of
              pickled peppers, Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper

              wood? He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as
              much wood as a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood.

              Betty Botter bought some butter But she said the butter's bitter
              If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter But a bit
              of better butter will make my batter better So 'twas better Betty
              Botter bought a bit of better butter

            <h2>Ed Nott</h2>
            <p>
              was shot and Sam Shott was not. So it is better to be Shott than
              Nott. Some say Nott was not shot. But Shott says he shot Nott.
              Either the shot Shott shot at Nott was not shot, or Nott was shot.
              If the shot Shott shot shot Nott, Nott was shot. But if the shot
              Shott shot shot Shott, the shot was Shott, not Nott. However, the
              shot Shott shot shot not Shott - but Nott. So, Ed Nott was shot
              and that's hot! Is it not?
